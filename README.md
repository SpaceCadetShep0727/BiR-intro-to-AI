# BiR-intro-to-AI
For BiR AI session

The files in the master code will run as intented. The files in the student's session code will not run unless the students complete the session exercises as listed in the TA slides 

Intructions: 
Running the astar.py file in the Master folder will open a pygame window 

press the "f" key to upload the maze onto the window
the first left click will create an orange square which represents the robot's start point 
the next lefft click will create a blue square which represents the end point 
any subsequent clicks will create black squares which are barriers to the path 

hold right click and hover over a square to clear it 

After creating a start and end point press the space bar to begin the path finding algorithm
If a solution is found it will be represented by a path of purple blocks.

Once a solution is found you can press the "r" key to run the animation. Note: The animation needs to be adjusted in some areas

pressing the "c" key clears the screen. 

Feel free to clone the repo for your own development. If you want to commit any changes please create a separate branch
Happy coding,
